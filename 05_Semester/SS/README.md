# Sensorial Systems

### Course Focus:

Sensors technology: principles of functioning, acquisition of information, models, analysis of cases (sensors of presence and proximity, force and contact, temperature). 

Ultrasounds Sensors: characteristics, processing of low-level sensorial information, feature extraction. Image processing: from pixels to features, operations over images, segmentation, object detection, feature extraction, measures, analysis of applications. Sensorial fusing and integration: characterization, models, analysis of cases.
