# Calculus I

### Course Focus:

Domain of the basic techniques required for the Mathematical Analysis of real functions of real variable.

The students should acquire not only calculus capabilities fundamental to the acquisition of some of the knowledge lectured in Physics, Chemistry and other Engineering subjects,  but also to develop methods of solid logic reasoning and analysis.

Being a first course in Mathematical Analysis, it introduces some of the concepts which will be deeply analyzed and generalized in subsequent courses.
